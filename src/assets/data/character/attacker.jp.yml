      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff and elemental post rush buff.
      
      - Huge AP recovery on normal buff.
      
      - Cheaper dodging and can air dodge.
      
      - Innate Light & Dark imbue
      
      - Has a melee and ranged skill set.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - ATK buff condition is inconsistent
      
      - Self imbue can be a downside against certain bosses if you don't own certain weapons.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      - As a note YoHRa Pod: One VS YoHRa Arms: two is a personal preference. Whether you want a better ranged combo or using arms two
      as a verticle dodge.
      
      *Normal > YoHRa Arms: One > YoHRa Pod: Two > YoHRa Arms: One > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoHRa Pod: Two > YoHRa Arms: One (Miss on purpose) > YoHRa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoHRa Pod: Two > YoHRa Pod: One > YoHRa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo if running ranged set up.)*

      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff for the party.
      
      - AP reduction and even more post rush allows skill spamming.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - Low ATK stat gives him lower damage compared to competing units.

      **Pros**
      
      - Gives a strong passive crit rate and an unmatched post rush buff to crit rate.
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.
      
      - Poor damage and little utility beyond crit buffing.

      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional good ATK buff
      
      - Rush combo damage buff
      
      - Defence debuff on rush for enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - ATK buff has been exceeded by many attackers making it redundant in a lot of comps
      
      - Silence has a low chance to apply making it a poor talent that doesn't do much
      
      - Doesn't do enough other attackers don't already do better

      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Extremely high damage output
      
      - Reasonably rare post rush buff and debuff
      
      - Built in AP reduction
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Quite squishy, especially pre-rush
      
      - Rush gain could be better

      **Pros**
      
      - Does a good amount of damage
      
      - Some weak utility to the party
      
      - Works well with hit counter characters if no ATK buffer
      
            
      **Cons**
            
      - Party Utility is weak without the right characters
      
      - If no ATK buffer it requires a high hit count to get the most out of her

      **Summary**
      
      Outdated unit, selfish talents without the damage to back it up.
   
      **Rotation**
      
      Normal > Rocket Punch > Hammer Slammer > Jump'n'Thump*3 (Replace Hammer Slammer with Force Field if 104 AP or higher)
