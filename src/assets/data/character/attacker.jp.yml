  notes: >
      _The meta breaker herself. 2B enters the game way ahead of schedule and even her nerfs do little to slow her down. 2B is an 
      all round great unit, she does good damage, has a melee and ranged combo while also providing powerful buffs. Her ATK buff is
      only matched by Lasswell when the condition is met and she gives AP recovery on normals that allows players to have overall
      higher damage output. She then also has a powerful elemental damage buff that matches many characters in the game post rush
      and the icing on the cake is she has a built in double imbue of light and dark._
      
      
      _For downsides the biggest one is her ATK buff conditional isn't the most consistent, each player has to keep their HP at 100%
      without a healer or party wide healing in some form this can be very difficult to get the full benefit from. Also talent based
      imbue is a double edged sword, while very good as it lets you use racial weapons against bosses your two imbues cover, you will
      need elemental imbue weapons to be effective against bosses who resist them. A good example of this in GL is Michael who resists
      everything but ice. Luckily ohs category has all but dark covered so if you have the ice imbue sword 2b can be used but you will
      need that specific weapon, thus why it is a weakness._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff and elemental post rush buff.
      
      - Huge AP recovery on normal buff.
      
      - Cheaper dodging and can air dodge.
      
      - Innate Light & Dark imbue
      
      - Has a melee and ranged skill set.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - ATK buff condition is inconsistent
      
      - Self imbue can be a downside against certain bosses if you don't own certain weapons.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      - As a note YoHRa Pod: One VS YoHRa Arms: two is a personal preference. Whether you want a better ranged combo or using arms two
      as a verticle dodge.
      
      *Normal > YoHRa Arms: One > YoHRa Pod: Two > YoHRa Arms: One > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoHRa Pod: Two > YoHRa Arms: One (Miss on purpose) > YoHRa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoHRa Pod: Two > YoHRa Pod: One > YoHRa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo if running ranged set up.)*
