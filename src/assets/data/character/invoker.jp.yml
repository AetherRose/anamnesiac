      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - In combat ATK buff.
      
      - Good buffs for Invokers.
      
      - Talents make her self sufficient and doesn't require party synergy.
      
      - Fire Bolt is a homing attack.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Talents are greedy outside of a caster composition.
      
      - Hard locked into fire. Has no real secondary element.
      
      - Staff casting.
      

      **Rotation**

      *Normal > CA Explosion > Fire Bolt > Explosion > Explosion (General damage rotation. Recommended with 101 AP.)*
      
      *Normal > CA Fire Bolt > Explosion > Fire Bolt (Moving target rotation.)*

    notes: >
      _Mavelle is here and brings a unique playstyle to the table. Unlike other invokers Mavelle is about being a true one skill
      wonder. She sets up her damage by using Aerial Lancer and Hail orb. After this she spends her time using her Arctic Impact and
      waiting for her AP to recharge until the buffs run out and repeat. It's not a play style for everyone but it's certainly not
      a bad one if you enjoy that kind of thing. She's a damage carry and does her job well, especially on Ice weak bosses where
      she'll really pack a punch. She also does at least bring party wide AP recovery which is a nice perk to give._
      
      _Her downsides are well, she's an invoker, she will always be elemental locked and she is essentially hard locked to ice due
      to her play style. Aurora rings may as well not even be a skill in her arsenal. Also Arctic Impact comes with two issues, it
      isn't good against moving targets and it sends stunned targets into the heavens. This can make her extremely frustrating to play
      alongside and to play as. But when she's hitting those big numbers, you'll quickly find her enjoyable._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Orb casting.
      
      - Unique play style.
      
      - Deals high damage, very good against ice weak enemies.
      
      - Ap recovery buff for the party.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Locked in on Ice.
      
      - Arctic Impact can send stunned enemies up high. It can also whiff against mobile foes.
