      _For Summer, Sophia decided to try out being a healer, while not actually giving up much in the way of her damage. She has a
      significantly higher INT stat than any other healer in the game and is an orb wielder on top, meaning she doesn't have to
      deal with the laggy staff animations that almost every other healer currently does. Her fast casts and spells mean she isn't
      that bad for wracking up hit count helping her rush gain._
      
      
      Her most powerful utility aspect however is her ability to be an
      AP battery, where casting certain offensive spells will grant AP to the other party members. This means she's good in just
      about any composition, though her post INT rush means she really shines with invokers. If SSophia has any weaknesses it would
      be that her actual heal is not the most potent in a pinch and may require a cancel bonus before hand._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Offensive spells restore AP to the party
      
      - Post rush buff that's powerful for self and other INT characters.
      
      - High damage. Especially for a healer.
      
      - Orb wielder, makes her less clunky and laggy compared to her staff counter parts.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak standalone heal. Highly depending on weaving it into her rotation for effectiveness.
      
      - This means the AI will suck with her. Hard.
      
      - Lightning Wave has a max range which can make it awkward to use.
      
      - Below average rush build.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Lightning Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo. Requires 2-3 AP seed.)*
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Faerie Light Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (No AP seed.)
      
      *Thunder Flare is a workable replacement for Lightning Wave and helps her rush build, but beware its higher AP cost.

  notes: >
      _Evelysse gets to be the first awakened healer and she's still kind of meh. She is a significant improvement over her old self
      this is due to to faster rush and shorter cast times. Her healing is now 10AP less as well meaning she can weave it more
      easily and use it sooner. She also can't have her casts interupted meaning emergency heals go off more and she's had some bulk 
      added. Her attacks and rush have also recieved damage boosts and she wasn't the weakest of healers especially post rush to begin
      with._
      
      _The main problem with awakened Eve is, she's better but still has the same problems. Her rush gain is slow, she has no guts to
      survive clutch heal moments, her casting is still slow and the added build isn't really that big of a deal. Her lack of a fifth
      skill is odd and really an extra skill could have gone a long way in giving Eve more utility but she still will continue to
      have to pay for her ability to res._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Can revive party members by rushing
      
      - Powerful post rush self buff that gives insane healing and damage
      
      - Consistent damage
      
      - Buffs INT and rush damage
      
      - Hard hitting rush compared to most healers
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Poor rush gain
      
      - Lack of powerful buffs for the party
      
      - Lack of a good talent that helps survivability

  notes: >
      _There is an 80% (90% after awakening) shortening effect of the cast and, in addition, because the weapon is a knuckle, the motion of the cast is short and the recovery motion is very fast . 
      As a healer who will recover after seeing that it is basically hit, "The second shot came and was killed when trying to recover," but the speed of recovery that can be reduced is advantageous. 

      _In addition, Angel Feather (abbreviation: AF) is an excellent skill that can temporarily strengthen both defensive and defensive parameters. 
      The battle skills will not be overwhelmed by reinforcements such as talents, so it is possible to reduce the risk of fighting as a healer with low firepower and difficulty in buffing. 
      It's even better if you look at the mark of parameter UP so that your buffs won't break, and if you get used to it, you will be able to put it in time. 
      Before waking up, the AP consumption of 95 is terrific, but when waking up it drops to 35 and it can be incorporated into cancellations, so it must be awake ._

      _When awakened, two physical attack techniques are added.
      The skill feathers and angel feathers can attack while gaining the same effect as the angel feathers (although not written as a whole, but the buff gets the whole). 
      The effective time is half, but it's hard to be bothered as you shoot while attacking._

      _In addition, physical skills are different from heraldry Shiny Lancer and Ray, and damage is calculated using ATK. However, if you wake up, Rena's ATK also rises, so you do not have to think basically. 
      In order to stabilize the turn, it is better to align the two skills other than Fairylight with two physics skills (carrent knuckle + qigong rule) or two crest techniques (angel feather + ray). 
      Generally speaking, physical types that are easily accessible to other characters' talents are easier to handle, but the power of ray is also greatly improved by awakening, so depending on the equipment and environment, there are also crest types for light attribute weaknesses._

      _As for the flow, while maintaining the buff of the angel feather, store the gauges with roar and fairy lights. When recovery is busy, buff just before rush. 
      If recovery is complete, it is easy for the gauge to be delayed, and it is easier to catch up with the normal attack. 
      However, since it is a healer, it is not necessary to go to the beat by force (especially heraldic type). Even if the gauge is somewhat delayed, it is good for the safe operation of the fairy light continuous hit._

      _Using Rays during an Elements Burst can contribute to the extension of time, as the Elements Burst will not melt during the duration of the game and will not be resolved during that time. 
      In addition, if you go into Ereba, you will push out the enemies, so if you hit them, stand with your friends and enemies._
      
      _She does have her downsides, you can only run one of her two damage spells and they're interchangable with
      lancer providing more damage, but lasers lets you complete rotations with faerie light faster. She has pretty slow rush gain
      especially if she's struggling to hit with her damage spells, and her melee normals make playing her a little awkward. In
      summary Rena is the best true healer we have right now, fast cast times, a strong buff, good healing output. But her low damage
      and slow rush gain leave something to be desire._   
      
      
      **TL DR - Needs Updated**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Fast cast times
      
      - Talents and post rush buff that is amazing for melee compositions
      
      - Hard to kill
      
      - Angel Feather stacks with all party passive buffs.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Low damage
      
      - Slow rush gain, unless you put yourself in danger by meleeing the boss
      
      - Melee range normals
      
      - Offers little to ranged characters
      
      - Radiant Lancer's damage and rush gain are backloaded onto the final hit, which sucks for especially mobile bosses
       
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Angel Feather (Remember to refresh this)*
      
      *Normal > Laser Beams > Laser Beams (Melee rotation w/ Beams)
      
      *Radiant Lancer > Faerie Light > Radiant Lancer. (Rotation w/ Lancer)*
      
      *Laser Beams > Faerie Light (Ranged rotation with Beams)*
      
      *Faerie Light > Spam till the party isn't dying. (Healing)*

      _Pre-awakening, she's nothing more than a healbot.  Post-awakening...healbotting is still what she's actively doing, but she's received decent
      party buffing for ATK-based parties, and now also amazingly boasts a revive for Attackers/Defenders on her rush without having her high rush
      gain compromised.  Also having passive Guts on top of this, she greatly exceeds Eve in both offensive and defensive support in most cases.
      Her own damage output is still effectively nothing, though._

      _It's somewhat noteworthy that Miki has by far and away the best regen available in the game on her rush prior to Awk10, but as a character
      who easily full heals with Fairy Star and doesn't have much else to be pressing, there isn't much need for it, and it'll actually hamper her AI's
      rush gain on auto by dissuading usage of Fairy Star postrush._

      _A passive healer, in multiple senses of the term; she has the worst offensive skillset in the game, but she passively increases both attribute
      and critical damage for the party, in addition to unconditional 80/10 Guts and 5%/3s regen.  Her rush provides an instant heal and +50% crit 
      rate, which synergizes well with her new awakening talents, and she's the only ace Healer with status clearing.  In short, she boosts damage 
      output a lot and makes dying nearly impossible just by existing._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong elemental damage buff for the party
      
      - Post rush buff that boosts critical rate and heals most of the party's HP
      
      - Talent that helps surviability
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Damage spells take a long time to cast making them bad
      
      - Common access to elemental damage buffs post rush that override her talent
      
      - Boring to play optimally
      
      - Expensive healing

      _Packs a slew of offensive and defensive buffs in addition to performing standard healer duties.  There's not a lot to add beyond what's already
      on the left; she makes the party bulky enough to adequately forego Defender stacking solo, and she also supplies the highest class of AP 
      regen available on top of stacking ATK+INT buffs, which contribute enough to make up for not having three dedicated attackers._      
      
      **TL DR**
      
     
      **Pros**
      
      - Both Faerie Light and Brute Englightenment (INT only) buffs stack with all passive party buffs, which is impressive utility.
      
      - Faerie Light having a Growth buff baked in makes it so much easier to maintain.
      
      - Talents that cover many of the AI's worst flaws in single player parties.
      
      - One of the most future proof characters in her niche.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction.
      
      - Rare single target DMG buff on her rush.
      
      
      **Cons**      
      
      - Staff animations and high AP costs.
      
      - Abysmal damage, among the worst in the game.
      
      - Attempting to maintain both Brute Enlightenment and Faerie Light really screws her rush gain.
      
      - Brute Enlightenment is a dead spell in most comps, and horrible in AI hands. Unequip it immediately for single player.
      
      - Low natural surviability.


      **Rotation**   
     
      - Enraging Faerie Light (Healing)
      
      - Normal > Enraging Faerie Light > Radiant Lancer/Aurora Rings ("Damage" rotation, best for rush gain)

      - Brute Enlightenment (Re-apply when necessary)*
