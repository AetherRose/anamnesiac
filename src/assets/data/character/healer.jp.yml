      _For Summer, Sophia decided to try out being a healer, while not actually giving up much in the way of her damage. She has a
      significantly higher INT stat than any other healer in the game and is an orb wielder on top, meaning she doesn't have to
      deal with the laggy staff animations that almost every other healer currently does. Her fast casts and spells mean she isn't
      that bad for wracking up hit count helping her rush gain._
      
      
      Her most powerful utility aspect however is her ability to be an
      AP battery, where casting certain offensive spells will grant AP to the other party members. This means she's good in just
      about any composition, though her post INT rush means she really shines with invokers. If SSophia has any weaknesses it would
      be that her actual heal is not the most potent in a pinch and may require a cancel bonus before hand._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Offensive spells restore AP to the party
      
      - Post rush buff that's powerful for self and other INT characters.
      
      - High damage. Especially for a healer.
      
      - Orb wielder, makes her less clunky and laggy compared to her staff counter parts.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak standalone heal. Highly depending on weaving it into her rotation for effectiveness.
      
      - This means the AI will suck with her. Hard.
      
      - Lightning Wave has a max range which can make it awkward to use.
      
      - Below average rush build.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Lightning Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo. Requires 2-3 AP seed.)*
      
      *Normal > Lightning Strike > Faerie Light Wave > Lightning Strike > Spam it till out of AP. (No AP seed.)
      
      *Thunder Flare is a workable replacement for Lightning Wave and helps her rush build, but beware its higher AP cost.
