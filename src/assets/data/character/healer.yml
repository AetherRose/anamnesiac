  notes: >
      _Evelysse isn't some useless poster girl who looks good and orders you around. She decides to get stuck in. She also happens to
      be the first character that has had buffs compared to their JP version counterpart. The reduction of cast times by 20% and the
      20% reduction to her rush gauge or global exclusive buffs. These buffs however aren't enough to make Eve outstanding and they
      still err on the side of caution with Evelysse. Her unique post rush ability to revive the party is very powerful, but the lack
      of ability to get to use it, and the fact that as a healer you should be trying to prevent deaths, don't really do much to make
      Eve a must pick. She also has long cast times even with the reduction so you have to pick your spells. Lancer is the best filler
      spell she has, but an enemy that likes moving makes conjure comet's ability to home very useful. If they ever fix the fact it
      crashes people on normal quality graphics settings. In all Evelysse is usable but not incredible, she brings some party buffs 
      that are on the weak side but not common in overlap currently. If you want to use her though, by all means do, just know it
      might be challenging in harder content._
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Lancer > Spam it till out of AP. (Damage Rotation)*
      
      *Normal > Conjure Comet > Spam it till out of AP. (Moving target rotation.)*
      
      *Normal > Lancer > Faerie Light (I don't trust my party/ Rush Gain Rotation)*
      
      *Faerie Light > Spam it till party isn't dying. (Healing)*
