  notes: >
      _A2 arrives exceptionally early for GL along with the other Nier characters. This also makes her the first Greatsword character
      for GL. A2 is an offensive tank, she hits very hard and even her talents are more damage focused. Like any defender she brings
      anti-flinch to the party, as well as a HP buff for the party. Her rush hits extremely hard, helps her deal even more damage and
      gives her health regen giving her sustain. This means that she is a favourite for going auto on content._
      
      
      _On top of all of this 
      perfect dodging restores AP to herself and the party. She also has the ability to either use a long or short ranged combo 
      depending on what you want to set. It's very hard to really think of any weaknesses she has and it will be a while before we get
      a defender that truly surpasses her. If you had to try and find one, it's that HP related talents aren't the most consistent._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Perfect dodging restores AP to the party
      
      - Strong buffs for both offense and defence.
      
      - High personal damage output, especially post rush.
      
      - Post rush regen gives sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - HP based talents aren't consistent without setting up a proper composition

  notes: >
      _Dias was the first defender ace we had and is rewarded by being the first defender to be awakened. Rather then try and give
      him a more all round kit like other top defenders, Dias doubles down on his composition oriented talents, in some cases
      he literally doubles them. First off we'll go over his kit. His moves are fine, a little dated but the buffs to them help
      increase damage output, on top of that he now has a big +50% self boost to his ATK. He has also gotten better at giving party
      bulk with his DEF buff now at 25% for the party and reducing ATK damage by 25% only 5% less then the best ATK damage reduction
      going._
      
      _His composition focused talents want him accompanied by only attackers and defenders, which sounds like Claude may be a good
      pick to go alongside him. No only does he provide a large 30% anti-flinch buff, he essentially replaces the sharpshooters by
      giving a 40% damage buff, matching that of base Maria._
      
      _His additional talents are underwhelming, taunt +3 should help him hold aggro and his other talent helps him regenerate health
      by holding CA. Not actively using it. Just standing there with it charging. Doing nothing. It's quite bad, but the improvements
      he gets are the real powerhouses here._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid ranged attacks
      
      - Strong party wide defensive buff.
      
      - Very good in a comp with just Attackers and defenders.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Some of his buffs are redundant for ranged characters.
      
      - Still the greatest pusher of all time.
      
      - Skill selection is a little lacklustre.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Annihiliating Air Slash > Double Slash > Annihiliating Air Slash > spam this until no AP - (Damage rotation)*
      
      *Annihiliating Air Slash > Dragon Roar > Annihiliating Air Slash > Dragon Roar > spam this until no AP - (Range rotation)*
