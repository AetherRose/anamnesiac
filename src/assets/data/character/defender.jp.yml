  notes: >
      _A2 arrives exceptionally early for GL along with the other Nier characters. This also makes her the first Greatsword character
      for GL. A2 is an offensive tank, she hits very hard and even her talents are more damage focused. Like any defender she brings
      anti-flinch to the party, as well as a HP buff for the party. Her rush hits extremely hard, helps her deal even more damage and
      gives her health regen giving her sustain. This means that she is a favourite for going auto on content._
      
      
      _On top of all of this 
      perfect dodging restores AP to herself and the party. She also has the ability to either use a long or short ranged combo 
      depending on what you want to set. It's very hard to really think of any weaknesses she has and it will be a while before we get
      a defender that truly surpasses her. If you had to try and find one, it's that HP related talents aren't the most consistent._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Perfect dodging restores AP to the party
      
      - Strong buffs for both offense and defence.
      
      - High personal damage output, especially post rush.
      
      - Post rush regen gives sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - HP based talents aren't consistent without setting up a proper composition
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Pod 1 > Pod 2 (Ranged combo)*
      
      *Normal > Pod 2 > Sword 11 > Sword 12 (Melee set combo)*
      
      *Normal > Pod 1 > Pod 2 > CA Sword 12 (Ranged set combo)*
      
      *Pod 2 > Pod 1 > Pod 2 > CA Sword 12 (Ranged set combo from range)*
