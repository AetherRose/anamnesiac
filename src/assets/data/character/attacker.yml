      _The meta breaker herself. 2B enters the game way ahead of schedule and even her nerfs do little to slow her down. 2B is an 
      all round great unit, she does good damage, has a melee and ranged combo while also providing powerful buffs. Her ATK buff is
      only matched by Lasswell when the condition is met and she gives AP recovery on normals that allows players to have overall
      higher damage output. She then also has a powerful elemental damage buff that matches many characters in the game post rush
      and the icing on the cake is she has a built in double imbue of light and dark._
      
      
      _For downsides the biggest one is her ATK buff conditional isn't the most consistent, each player has to keep their HP at 100%
      without a healer or party wide healing in some form this can be very difficult to get the full benefit from. Also talent based
      imbue is a double edged sword, while very good as it lets you use racial weapons against bosses your two imbues cover, you will
      need elemental imbue weapons to be effective against bosses who resist them. A good example of this in GL is Michael who resists
      everything but ice. Luckily ohs category has all but dark covered so if you have the ice imbue sword 2b can be used but you will
      need that specific weapon, thus why it is a weakness._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff and elemental post rush buff.
      
      - Huge AP recovery on normal buff.
      
      - Cheaper dodging and can air dodge.
      
      - Innate Light & Dark imbue
      
      - Has a melee and ranged skill set.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - ATK buff condition is inconsistent
      
      - Self imbue can be a downside against certain bosses if you don't own certain weapons.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      - As a note YoRHa Pod: One VS YoRHa Arms: two is a personal preference. Whether you want a better ranged combo or using arms two
      as a verticle dodge.
      
      *Normal > YoRHa Arms: One > YoRHa Pod: Two > YoRHa Arms: One > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoRHa Pod: Two > YoRHa Arms: One (Miss on purpose) > YoRHa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo.)*
      
      *Normal > YoRHa Pod: Two > YoRHa Pod: One > YoRHa Pod: Two > Spam it till out of AP. (Ranged combo if running ranged set up.)*

      _Fidel, the starter character and sometimes face of the app icon. Fidel has suffered as time has gone on. He has the highest
      unconditional party wide buff in the game at 40%. Though both Lasswell and 2B can surpass it with the right conditions and
      party composition. His AP reduction talent and really potent AP reduection post rush, lets him really output a lot of damage
      by chaining attacks._
      
      
      _For downsides well all he is bringing to the party is an ATK buff, characters like 2B and Halloween Millie bring similar or
      suprior levels of buffing with AP recovery on top. Even the freebie Ace of the FFBE collab Lasswell brings a slight bonus
      to melee characters in movement field nullification. His damage is also not stellar, he has quite a low attack stat compared
      to other attacks and his party wide buff and ability to spam attacks more don't make up for it compared to other attackers._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong ATK based buff for the party.
      
      - AP reduction and even more post rush allows skill spamming.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - Low ATK stat gives him lower damage compared to competing units.

      _Cliff comes in as the first attacker carry ace. A fun knuckles wielding character who has a lot of strong selfish buffs that
      help him dish out plenty of damage. He's good for solo content, or when the party is built for getting the best out of him.
      His combination of ATK buff, crit rate buff and AP reduction buff gives him a faster paced playstyle then many other
      characters in the game. His rush also packs one hell of a punch as well, with a massive multiplier on it to make up for the
      lack of post rush buff._
      
      
      _For downsides his greed is his undoing, if the party isn't playing to strengths he isn't as effective. He lacks any kind of 
      ranged option, so playing it safe or keeping up some form of damage during certain attacks isn't really an option. Also not
      having a post rush buff kind of sucks and means his damage really has to make up for it._

      _Anne is a character who fills a niche and that's about it. She's very good against the crystal Guardian, other than that
      nearly every other 5 star character in the game is better than her. She is a crit fiend and provides the best crit buff in
      the game a post rush 60%, plus a 30% crit rate for the party passively is nothing to ignore. But that's about all she has
      going for her. Her damage is bad, she gives no other utility, she has no ranged option, and being a non-ace means she has
      less stats so is just generally squishier. If you need a character to do Crystal Guardian she's a great pick, other wise
      ignore her._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Gives a strong passive crit rate and an unmatched post rush buff to crit rate.
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats.

      _Papa Camuze enters the game in order to show his son how it's done. By being kind of bad as well. Daril, like his son, brings
      a powerful party wide utility in the form of -20% to AP cost. This grows to an even more potent -40% as a post rush buff. His
      anti-humanoid talent does give him above average damage against humanoids but it's lacklustre otherwise. His AP reduction
      does allow for 20 second rush cycles and helps characters such as healers who don't have reduction with their high cost
      AP skills/spells._
      
      
      _His downsides are numerous, being a 5 star he has less stats then an ace. His AP reduction is powerful but it's all he brings
      to the table. His damage is also poor if not up against a humanoid. Plus for characters who already have large AP cost reduction
      talents he isn't doing anything for them except post rush and that just isn't good enough. In summary Daril fills a nice niche
      to play around with in a pre-made party but he isn't very good beyond that._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful AP reduction party wide buff.

      He also provides any casters with a slight cast time buff. As well as buffing his own attack. On top of that his post rush buff
      while selfish is very powerful for him. Though the main reason to run him, is for the much easier stuns that can just lock
      enemies in place for an entire fight._
      
      
      _He does have downsides, he isn't providing any stellar party wide buffs but his stun rate. He struggles with compositions who
      don't really benefit from bolstering rushes or with characters who aren't running an element imbue. He also doesn't pack
      as much punch as some of the other attackers you can bring. However if you're struggling to get a clear, try finding a good
      Roddick player and see if the extra elemental bursts make an improvement to your runs._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Slight invoking time buff.
      
      - Ridiculous buff to party wide stun rate.
      
      - Strong greedy post rush buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Brings little utility beyond his stun buff.
      
      - Needs some slight build around to take advantage of his buff.

      _Summer Reimi enters the game to make guys drool over her shorts and to be a solid attack buffer. Though time has seen summer
      Reimi get powercrept little by little her buffs are still solid. AP recovery is always great to have on normals, and 80% is a
      meaty amount. Her attack buffs are still powerful, especially when not in front of the boss and increasing rush damage is not
      yet a common buff we see in GL so it's unlikely she'll have that made redundant in most comps. She also has a very powerful
      post rush buff, only matched by Winter Evelysse at 150+ hit count, and curing status ailments can be relevant in certain fights._
      
      
      _Reimi still has some issues beyond being powercrept. For a start her rush gain is on the slower side. Getting the most out of
      her attack buff can be awkward as well, and the smoothie spam can make for a less then interesting playstyle. Overall Summer
      Reimi is still a solid character in GL but is probably looking forward to the summer where hopefully her nerfs will be
      removed and she may even get some buffs._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buffs
      
      - Ap recovery on normals
      
      - Really powerful post rush buff
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Slow rush gain
      
      - Awkward attack buff

      _Lenneth entered the game as a kind of worse Summer Reimi, and has fallen off the mark pretty fast. Her attack buff applies to
      the party and is unconditional, but at this point it's been matched by Lasswell. Her rush combo damage buff is still on the 
      rare side and hers is better than Summer Reimi's. Silencing on attacks is, okay, useful if it goes off but there are no
      guarantees. Her post rush debuff is quite strong and pretty unique as well which is probaby her strongest tool left in her kit._
      
      
      _However all of this doesn't really mean you want to run her. No AP recovery like most of the high tier attack buffers bring
      her attack buff is even beaten by Fidel, never mind the likes oh Halloween Millie and 2B. Her rush debuff is nice as is her
      rush combo damage buff but it's not enough to really make the unit more viable then several other options in both the limited 
      and permanent ace attacker pool._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional good ATK buff
      
      - Rush combo damage buff
      
      - Defence debuff on rush for enemies.
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - ATK buff has been exceeded by many attackers making it redundant in a lot of comps
      
      - Silence has a low chance to apply making it a poor talent that doesn't do much
      
      - Doesn't do enough other attackers don't already do better

      _Claude is a very specific attack buffer, he gives a massive attack boost to Attackers and Defenders, he also provides 
      some survability to healers on top which is a nice perk. He's a character which is quite good when the meta is dominated by
      defenders and attackers. But bad if we have any sharpshooters or invokers who see their way into frequent play. He also
      provides everyone AP recovery on normals. Claude's buffs mean he is definetly a character suited to a certain comp. His post
      rush buff is reasonably strong, especially if you're trying to avoid shooters as the most prominent damage buffs come from Maria
      and 9S._
      
      
      _The negatives I've already touched on, he's not offering much but AP recovery to shooters and Invokers meaning that he's kind
      of redundant with them on his team, especially with the likes of Maria or 9S who make his post rush buff redundant as well.
      Though over all if you build a team with Claude in mind they'll be able to dish out some serious damage._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful ATK buff for attackers and defenders

      - Ap recovery on Normals
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Poor synergy with sharpshooters and invokers
      
      - Post rush buff made redundant by commonly seen characters like Maria and 9S

      _A 5 star non-ace who is similar to Cliff in design. Phia has the advantage of being ranged, which means she can play things
      a little safer then Cliff. Phia is a critical hit fiend. Boasting a huge critical hit rate and damage buff of 50% for herself.
      She also increases her own ATK while decreasing her own DEF by 20% making her quite the glass cannon. She's great for Crystal
      Guardian for a start, but an experienced player can use her effectively as a damage carry in a wide variety of content._
      
      
      _Aside from the lesser stats of not being an Ace Phia has her fair share of issues. Just like Cliff she provides no utility to
      the party beyond the occasional freezing of an enemy. Also her low defence coupled with the general lower stats of a non-ace
      mean she isn't recommended for new players or taking on new content as she is extremly squishy and is best used when you know
      how to get the best out of her and not tank the floor._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High damage output
      
      - 5 star non-ace so costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Can freeze enemies
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Provides nothing to the rest of the party
      
      - Glass cannon so not new player or new content friendly

  notes: >
      _As free units go, Lasswell is surprisingly higher quality than previous offerings. He is essentially a poverty Claude, offering
      ATK+45% to close range allies and 30% baseline. Alongside his decent dps, he is competitive with 2B in proper comps, and he 
      nullifies Slow Fields too. On top of all of this he's also had 3 of his 4 skills buffed from JP, Tranquility and Mirror of
      Haze both have their ATK multiplier increased from 200 to 250. His main damage dealing skill also recieves a slight buff,
      increasing its multiplier from 400 to 450. This means he'll pack a bit more punch than originally expected._
      
      
      _His rush buff might as well not exist, as it is easily overwritten by the likes of Maria and 9S, and he has no AP on-hit, 
      like 2B does. but you can't ask for everything, can you? You and your fantasies can never be quenched, can they?!_
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional ATK buff, that gets even better for melee characters.
      
      - Nullifies annoying movement fields for melee.
      
      - Free MLB Ace
      
      - Innate Ice Imbue attacks
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Does little for ranged characters
      
      - Gives no AP recovery unlike other buffers
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Exorcising Storm > Tranquility > Blade Flash - Awakened > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo.)*
