  notes: >
      _As free units go, Lasswell is surprisingly higher quality than previous offerings. He is essentially a poverty Claude, offering
      ATK+45% to close range allies and 30% baseline. Alongside his decent dps, he is competitive with 2B in proper comps, and he 
      nullifies Slow Fields too. On top of all of this he's also had 3 of his 4 skills buffed from JP, Tranquility and Mirror of
      Haze both have their ATK multiplier increased from 200 to 250. His main damage dealing skill also recieves a slight buff,
      increasing its multiplier from 400 to 450. This means he'll pack a bit more punch than originally expected._
      
      
      _His rush buff might as well not exist, as it is easily overwritten by the likes of Maria and 9S, and he has no AP on-hit, 
      like 2B does. but you can't ask for everything, can you? You and your fantasies can never be quenched, can they?!_
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional ATK buff, that gets even better for melee characters.
      
      - Nullifies annoying movement fields for melee.
      
      - Free MLB Ace
      
      - Innate Ice Imbue attacks
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Does little for ranged characters
      
      - Gives no AP recovery unlike other buffers
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Exorcising Storm > Tranquility > Blade Flash - Awakened > Spam it till out of AP. (General combo.)*
