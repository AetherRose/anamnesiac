  notes: >
      _You could say there are two flavors of Nel Zepher: the flavor where the boss is vulnerable to poison and the flavor where the
      boss is not. Rare is a character who is this polarized by a singular detail.
      
      A Nel against a poison-vulnerable boss has potential to be among the strongest dps in the game, capable of melting high HP bosses
      in seconds, on top of having incredible defensive utility and a great offensive buffing kit. If the boss can't be poisoned,
      her dps is among the worst in the game, and she becomes more of a support/utility character.
      
      Thankfully, that utility is pretty good. Her fast rush gain enables her to basically erase anything a boss does that
      can feasibly be threatening with the only downside being a hitcount reset (which is granted, significant). Her AP reduction
      raises everyone's dps, and is commonly underestimated. Her crit+10% isn't incredible, but it's a nice bonus.
      
      In the end, she's a character you probably won't bring to every boss. But when she's toxic, she is truly beautiful._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Poison damage is ridiculous.

      - Good general-purpose buffing.

      - Fastest rush gain in the game, enabling her to effectively erase boss mechanics on command.

      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Without poison vulnerability, her dps is abysmal.

      - A poorly played Nel can grief the party by resetting hitcount unnecessarily, cutting elem bursts short or constantly interrupting the fight.

      - Repel+1 hampers her ability to assume Shooter's primary role: kiting.

      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Poisonous Terror)

      - Poisonous Blade is a horrible move with horrible tracking and a tiny hitbox, and her best dps relies on it.
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > P.Terror > P.Shot > P.Terror > * (Best Rush Gain)*

      *Normal > P.Shot > P.Blade > P.Shot > * (General Damage)*

      *Normal > CA P.Blade (to align) > P.Shot > P.Blade > * (Best Damage vs. Big Targets)*

      _Come to me, dark warriors, obsolescence awaits us!
      
      Silmeria arrived in an unfortunate position out the gate. Bound by the high expectations following Maria and Clair, gagged by
      the fact that everyone owned the former. The only way Silmeria could have avoided what followed is if she had strong talents,
      damage and kiting ability. Well, she does bring damage. Unfortunately, she is luckluster on the rest.
      
      Her buffing is average at best; while it's nice that she has Single Target DMG at all, 10% is barely noticeable and underwhelming
      compared to Maria's crit chance buffs or Clair's anti-flinch. Kiting with her is a pain due to bow's generally terrible animations
      and mechanics, with nothing to help her AP recovery. And she WILL be kiting, because she has ridiculous aggro generation.
      
      She is best run with a defender so she can focus on doing what she does best: damage._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.

      - Decent rush gain.

      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.

      - Rare single target DMG buff.

      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian

      **Cons**

      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.

      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.

      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.

  notes: >
      _Clair joins us as a freebie for Valentine in Tri-Aces gift to us by giving us an alt of best girl. She also isn't that bad of
      a free unit and continues the Clair trend of having some defensive utility in her talents or post rush. She's a solid character
      who's combat style is similar to that of Maria, relying heavily on how good Crimson Squall is. This actually makes her good at
      building up and maintaining hit count, while also giving her decent rush gain. She's a humanoid specialist with her inbuilt
      humanoid slayer and has a built in AP reduction allowing her to spam moves even more. 
      
      She provides poison immunity to the party meaning she has a niche in MoT and against certain bosses like the valentine boss 
      she releases alongside. Her real power lays in her post rush buff, a rare 30 second duration and pretty rare debuffs. While 
      lowering enemy DEF isn't that big a damage boost unless you have no crit buffing, in theory lowering ATK is a pretty good
      debuff for defensive utility.
      
      Her downsides are that she doesn't provide much other than her debuffs and poison immunity to the party, and poison immunity
      is pretty niche even if it's nice to have. Her personal damage isn't going to blow you away just like most SS and unlike Maria
      her talents don't make up for it as much, though on Humanoid bosses she should be pretty solid. Just overall she isn't a
      spectacular character but like some of our other recent freebies she's okay and very much a playable character even in harder
      content._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good at building and maintaing Hit Count.

      - Decent rush gain.

      - Effective against Humanoids.

      - Poison Immunity.

      - Unique and strong debuffs.
      
      - Free MLB non-ace 5 star.

      **Cons**

      - Non-ace so has less stats.

      - Deals underwhelming damage outside of humanoid fights.

      - Underwhelming buffs.
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Crimson Squall > Sonic Thorn > Crimson Squall > Spam till out of AP  (General Combo.)*
