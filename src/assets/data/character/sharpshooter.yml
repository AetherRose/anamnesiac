    notes: >
      _You could say there are two flavors of Nel Zepher: the flavor where the boss is vulnerable to poison and the flavor where the
      boss is not. Rare is a character who is this polarized by a singular detail.
      
      A Nel against a poison-vulnerable boss has potential to be among the strongest dps in the game, capable of melting high HP bosses
      in seconds, on top of having incredible defensive utility and a great offensive buffing kit. If the boss can't be poisoned,
      her dps is among the worst in the game, and she becomes more of a support/utility character.
      
      Thankfully, that utility is pretty good. Her fast rush gain enables her to basically erase anything a boss does that
      can feasibly be threatening with the only downside being a hitcount reset (which is granted, significant). Her AP reduction
      raises everyone's dps, and is commonly underestimated. Her crit+10% isn't incredible, but it's a nice bonus.
      
      In the end, she's a character you probably won't bring to every boss. But when she's toxic, she is truly beautiful._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Poison damage is ridiculous.
      - Good general-purpose buffing.
      - Fastest rush gain in the game, enabling her to effectively erase boss mechanics on command.
      - Daggers are a great weapon, with excellent kiting ability.
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Without poison vulnerability, her dps is abysmal.
      - A poorly played Nel can grief the party by resetting hitcount unnecessarily, cutting elem bursts short or constantly interrupting the fight.
      - Repel+1 hampers her ability to assume Shooter's primary role: kiting.
      - High animation lock on her best rush generation move (Poisonous Terror)
      - Poisonous Blade is a horrible move with horrible tracking and a tiny hitbox, and her best dps relies on it.
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > P.Terror > P.Shot > P.Terror > * (Best Rush Gain)*
      *Normal > P.Shot > P.Blade > P.Shot > * (General Damage)*
      *Normal > CA P.Blade (to align) > P.Shot > P.Blade > * (Best Damage vs. Big Targets)*

    notes: >
      _Come to me, dark warriors, obsolescence awaits us!
      
      Silmeria arrived in an unfortunate position out the gate. Bound by the high expectations following Maria and Clair, gagged by
      the fact that everyone owned the former. The only way Silmeria could have avoided what followed is if she had strong talents,
      damage and kiting ability. Well, she does bring damage. Unfortunately, she is luckluster on the rest.
      
      Her buffing is average at best; while it's nice that she has Single Target DMG at all, 10% is barely noticeable and underwhelming
      compared to Maria's crit chance buffs or Clair's anti-flinch. Kiting with her is a pain due to bow's generally terrible animations
      and mechanics, with nothing to help her AP recovery. And she WILL be kiting, because she has ridiculous aggro generation.
      
      She is best run with a defender so she can focus on doing what she does best: damage._
      
      **TL DR**
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Good damage.
      - Decent rush gain.
      - Fast hitcount generation, making her a good friend to units dependent on it.
      - Rare single target DMG buff.
      - Self crit buff on Rush for Crystal Guardian

      **Cons**

      - Long rush animation guaranteed to annoy your party.
      - Bow animations make kiting bosses harder than it needs to be, and she is often forced into that due to high aggro gen.
      - Underwhelming buffs, especially compared to shooters of similar strength.
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Homing Pigeons > Wave Motion > Homing Pigeons > * (General Combo. By timing cancel can get up to 3 pigeons.)
      *Normal > Wave Motion > Homing Pigeons > Wave Motion > Homing Pigeons (Combo #2, last pigeons requires timed canceling)
      *Normal > Wave Motion > Homing Pigeons > Wave Motion > * (with 20% AP reduction or more)
