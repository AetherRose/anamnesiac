    - desc: 40% chance of freezing nullification
    - desc: 2% HP recovery every 5 seconds
  obtained: NieR Geared Wisp (Gacha/Drop)

  notes: >
    It's okay, it does its job on the Nier units which it comes with to help keep their HP topped off from minor incidental damage from trash mobs before the boss floor. MLBable.

  factors:
    - desc: 40% chance of poison nullification
    - desc: Damage taken -5%
  obtained: Pumpkin Cryptvine (Exchange/Drop)

  notes: >
    Decent, damage taken is reasonable, and poison resist, while small, is at least bundled with something useful. Good for new players to grab a few copies, may want to lvl10 multiples if drops are not kind, or a few MLB if lucky.

  obtained: Gerel (Exchange)

  notes: >
    Not recommended due to it's inconsistencies, much safer to use a unit in order to resist poison due to 50% not being reliable. Use as DEF stat stick if you're lazy (and don't want to unequip units when switching characters).
