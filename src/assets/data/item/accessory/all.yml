    Decent, damage taken is reasonable, and poison resist, while small, is at least bundled with something useful. Good for new players to grab a few copies, may want to lvl10 multiples if drops are not kind, or a few MLB if lucky.

    Guts is great, but there are better alternatives. However this isn't a bad choice to use on Maria, as she does not gain from the protection armlet (true for anyone else with damage reduction).

  notes: >
    It's okay. You can throw this on a DPS if you want, but HIT has very little impact on crit chance unless your HIT reaches 1100+. Use as DEF stat stick if you're lazy (and don't want to unequip units when switching characters). If you want to try to increase your offense just a little bit, worth running on someone who can't use another accessory well. Shooters mainly.

  notes: >
    Excellent accesory, its own downside being that it's not MLB-able at the moment, meaning less DEF if choosing to run it. Crit rate pre-rush is an excellent invisible damage booster (the first acc to do so) and stun rate is great when lacking either in talents.

  notes: >
    Beats Snow God. INT damage is at least a quantifiable stat with visible benefits, and has the bonus of not being common on too many units. However, when paired with SMyu/Reimi, this has no use aside from stat stick. MLB'able as well. Thankfully, it stacks with regular damage taken.

    A slight talent upgrade to the Resolve accessory, which unfortunately we can't MLB. HP isn't bad and for what it's worth it stacks with other talents, given that HP is a pre-battle stat buff. 30% chance also visually looks better than 20%. Overall quite usable, consider on Maria/SMyuria when not running something offensive.

    Average accessory, does stack with regular DMG reduction (like Maria), and adds a little bit with GRD. Otherwise, a stat stick, though notably does likely perform as well as an MLB accessory for DEF alone.

    HIT +10% for shooters, mainly Maria, a decent substitute for Snow God, and also comes with INT damage down as a bonus. Pretty decent accessory for units who can't run something else (Hawkeye, Protection).

    Certainly an interesting accessory. It's not amazing, but again has synergy on the Nier units for keeping their health high for doing something that you should be doing anyway. The guaranteed status clear is quite nice for bosses where statuses are common. May be useful for newbies in maze.
