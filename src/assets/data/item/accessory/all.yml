    It's okay, it does its job on the Nier units which it comes with to help keep their HP topped off from minor incidental damage from trash mobs before the boss floor. MLBable.

    Decent, damage taken is reasonable, and poison resist, while small, is at least bundled with something useful. Good for new players to grab a few copies, may want to lvl10 multiples if drops are not kind, or a few MLB if lucky.

  notes: >
    Not recommended due to it's inconsistencies, much safer to use a unit in order to resist poison due to 50% not being reliable. Use as DEF stat stick if you're lazy (and don't want to unequip units when switching characters).

    Nothing of note to use for yet, Michael being maybe the first boss where this can be useable. Use as DEF stat stick if you're lazy (and don't want to unequip units when switching characters).

    Guts is great, but there are better alternatives. However this isn't a bad choice to use on Maria, as she does not gain from the protection armlet (true for anyone else with damage reduction).

    Great accessory to use, doesn't stack with talents but for the current meta-game, it is the go to. Flat damage reduction is great.

  notes: >
    It's okay. You can throw this on a DPS if you want, but HIT has very little impact on crit chance unless your HIT reaches 1100+. Use as DEF stat stick if you're lazy (and don't want to unequip units when switching characters). If you want to try to increase your offense just a little bit, worth running on someone who can't use another accessory well. Shooters mainly.

  obtained: Eternal Queen (Achievement)

  notes: >
    Excellent accesory, its own downside being that it's not MLB-able at the moment, meaning less DEF if choosing to run it. Crit rate pre-rush is an excellent invisible damage booster (the first acc to do so) and stun rate is great when lacking either in talents.

  obtained: Millioneyes (Exchange, Drop)

  notes: >
    Beats Snow God. INT damage is at least a quantifiable stat with visible benefits, and has the bonus of not being common on too many units. However, when paired with SMyu/Reimi, this has no use aside from stat stick. MLB'able as well. Thankfully, it stacks with regular damage taken.

  obtained: Millioneyes (Achievement)

  notes: >
    A slight talent upgrade to the Resolve accessory, which unfortunately we can't MLB. HP isn't bad and for what it's worth it stacks with other talents, given that HP is a pre-battle stat buff. 30% chance also visually looks better than 20%. Overall quite usable, consider on Maria/SMyuria when not running something offensive.
