  notes: >
    A limited weapon and a fantastic weapon for 2b and also Fayt. Great mech hate, big lifesteal bonus and a good mlb factor. Buffing
    your attribute damage is what makes it particularly good on fayt and 2b but it's a pretty solid neutral weapon at mlb especially
    against mech bosses.
