    It's a passable staff but there are better, the gacha pool has two 40% light damage boosters in it and radiant lancer is only really
    relevant to several healers, all of whom either have a better spell for damage or their damage is so poor it doesn't matter anyway.

    If you're not sure what staff to get from the coin shop, this is a good pick. It's good on any caster due to it's INT boosting, both
    healer and invoker. It's second factor has synergy with both Miki and Eve, while the third factor is a very powerful regen and only
    needs to be lb 3 for it so I highly recommend making the extra effort.

    A staff meant for Lymle that turns her into a decent enough fire caster if you lack Sophia. The INT boost helps make up for the lack
    of stats, the third factor is a nice perk if you lack a crit buffer and doubling your rush damage is never a bad thing. It's bad
    for anyone else compared to easily obtained staffs like Winged Scepter.

    A poor pull from the gacha, it boosts plasma cyclone for Myuria and the AoE damage, but area of effect has such limited use in a
    game more focused on boss encounters. I'd just fodder it but you can hold onto it if you really want.

    The best weapon for Myuria. It gives a massive boost to her lightning damage and even comes with a couple of weak slayer factors

    A bit of an odd staff, it deals pretty good damage for light casters, and the mlb factor helps prevent taking aggro. The HP buff is

    Event weapon meant for Celine. Compared to the usual trash that is the event weapons, this one is surprisingly good. At MLB it's
    quite comparable with Holy Wand for Celine, sacrificing stats for two beneficial factors. However there are multiple good staffs
    for Celine in the gacha pool so you'll probably pull one of those eventually so you can use this for fodder unless you have nothing

    A more offensive choice for light casters. The crit rate and damage boost along with the light damage boost allow them to output
    some big numbers. The final factor gives a nice defensive buff which isn't super common to find so can have relevance.

    So this staff is garbage. We will get a version of Reimi to join Myuria in having ice as their secondary element, but for both you
    want to focus on what they're good at. For INT scaling the winged scepter is better and the only character this weapon is good for
    is if you want to maximise your meme value with Oracle Nel who is an ice based healer. Otherwise it is fodder.
