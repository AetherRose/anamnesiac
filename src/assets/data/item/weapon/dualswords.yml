  notes: >
    The best dual swords in the neutral slot currently. Attack scaling, helps make up for the lack of stats, the life steal is nice for
    sustain and the third factor is a nice damage bonus that has synergy with the second factor. Very good to pick up from the coin
    shop.

    Pretty bad pair of swords. The only blades in the transmute pool so you'll be seeing these a lot when trying to make coins. The 
    factors are bad so just fodder it.

    Light imbued dual swords that increase crit rate and damage. The third factor isn't as important due to the amount of AP recovery
    talents we see now, so don't feel the need to get these to MLB. Good weapon for any Dual Sword user.

    Decent dual swords for Halloween Clair, but beyond that they aren't fantastic. Passable if nothing better but Baphomet Blades or
    imbue weapons should see this gotten rid of.

    Decent dual swords for Winter Evelysse, but beyond that they aren't fantastic. The damage isn't great but gives her some sustain
    and some extra bulkiness at mlb while buffing her main damage dealing skill. Transmute if you have better.

    Good pair of dual swords that with ice imbue. The other two factors reward using normals helping give both AP recovery and some 
    sustain. All around solid weapon that you should make regular use of.

    Dual Swords meant for Ahston, they're not great, conditional damage buff, meh grit chance, piercing blades is a good attack
    but not your main source of damage. It's passable if you have nothing better for Ashton, otherwise it is bad.

  notes: >
    Ice imbue dual swords that cost 2 coins each from the shop. They're really meant for Ashton but it's an imbue weapon with a
    somewhat relevant second factor, though best not relied upon. Not worth lbing unless you have Ashton but well worth grabbing
    a copy.
