    It's a good demon hating weapon and a decent neutral option since it has grit chance. Otherwise it works as a strong enough neutral
    weapon. Worth keeping.

    A gun meant for Maria, so unsurprisingly, it's pretty good for Maria due to how much she uses Crimson Squall. The first factor is
    a bit limited but getting the third factor turns it into a pretty good neutral weapon.

  notes: >
    An elemental weapon, while wind isn't a common element weakness it'll always contribute to elemental burst. The second factor is
    for Emmerson so is redundant but just being an element gun is enough. It's also very easy to get to MLB due to it having three
    methods to obtain it.

    Like any event weapon it's decent for it's intended character, Winter Fidel, but bad beyond that. Even though it has lifesteal it
    isn't good enough to be keeping if you have better options. So just fodder it.

    A fantastic weapon. Has elemental imbue plus a slight racial hate. On top of that AP reduction and a powerful third factor to reward
    the lucky and rich. If you get one of these treasure it.

    A pretty strong neutral weapon. A 3+ chain is pretty easy on most gun characters. The first factor is for Emmerson's rush but the 
    second and third factor are what make it a pretty solid weapon.

    The Icy Revolver's little brother. It's not on the level of that weapon but for those who don't have it, or for those running two
    gun wielders. It's a good pick up. It's factors are solid and it contributes to ele damage so it's worth keeping but not chasing.

    A neutral weapon for hating on plants. It's okay it's grit factor makes it slightly worse neutral than the wave gun and it's final
    factor will be cancelled out or matched in GLs current defender fest of a meta, but it'll serve you well if you have no elemental
    gun.

    A decent event weapon meant for OAnne. ATK damage buffs are still at a premium on GL and some basic sustain is always welcome. If
    you don't have a decent gun, this gun is just a good neutral option. Gets beaten out by elemental weapons or specific slayer
    weapons though.

    An upgraded Storm Bolt but not upgraded enough to make it worth chasing, nice if you pull it. It has better stats but not by much
    it's third factor is pretty bad on a long range weapon. However it's second factor boosts crit rate which is okay but also boosts
    crit damage. This is very good when you consider characters like Maria and OAnne boost crit rate significantly post rush but not
    crit damage, meaning it has good synergy with them.
