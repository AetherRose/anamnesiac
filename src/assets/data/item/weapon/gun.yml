    It's a good demon hating weapon and a decent neutral option since it has grit chance. Otherwise it works as a strong enough neutral
    weapon. Worth keeping.

    A gun meant for Maria, so unsurprisingly, it's pretty good for Maria due to how much she uses Crimson Squall. The first factor is
    a bit limited but getting the third factor turns it into a pretty good neutral weapon.

  notes: >
    An elemental weapon, while wind isn't a common element weakness it'll always contribute to elemental burst. The second factor is
    for Emmerson so is redundant but just being an element gun is enough. It's also very easy to get to MLB due to it having three
    methods to obtain it.

    This gun is bad. Please fodder it. Use it to work towards coins for Storm Bolt. Only use it if it's your only gun and you can't turn
    it into a coin for Storm Bolt.

    Like any event weapon it's decent for it's intended character, Winter Fidel, but bad beyond that. Even though it has lifesteal it
    isn't good enough to be keeping if you have better options. So just fodder it.

    A fantastic weapon. Has elemental imbue plus a slight racial hate. On top of that AP reduction and a powerful third factor to reward
    the lucky and rich. If you get one of these treasure it.

    An event weapon for Official Lymle. It is only good for Official Lymle. Use them for fodder or mlb it and stick it on Official
    Lymle if you fancy playing her for fun from time to time.

    A pretty strong neutral weapon. A 3+ chain is pretty easy on most gun characters. The first factor is for Emmerson's rush but the 
    second and third factor are what make it a pretty solid weapon.

    The Icy Revolver's little brother. It's not on the level of that weapon but for those who don't have it, or for those running two
    gun wielders. It's a good pick up. It's factors are solid and it contributes to ele damage so it's worth keeping but not chasing.
