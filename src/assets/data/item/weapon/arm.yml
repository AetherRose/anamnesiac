    They're alright if you lack other options but not ideal compared to the other coin shop or gacha alternatives. You can fodder these if
    you have any other neutral arms weapon.

    An event weapon for Halloween Millie. They're pretty good for her giving Lantern Burst a huge damage boost and providing a 
    rare buff to rush damage if you're over a certain hit count. The third factor will regularly be relevant as well so worth keeping
    while the pool is so small.

    An Earth imbue arms. It has some good factors that compliment playing aggressive with build in conditional anti-flinch, damage
    reduction and at mlb a boost to critical hit rate and damage means it's a good elemental weapon to help contribute to stunning.
